The dispatcher will need to push all the messages (direct or thread, all) into the queue called "messages". 
The orchestrator will listen the "messages" queue, 
*  if the message doesn't have thread_id it will create a dpeloyment (scaled to 1) for the thread id.
and then the consumer in orchstrator will push the message to the thread_message_[deploymentid] queue for the worker to listen.
we will have one queue for each thread, prefixed with thread_message_.
