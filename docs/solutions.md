## Automatic PR Code Review

**When to use:** Automatically review every PR opened or updated in your repository.

**Complete Example:**

```yaml
name: Claude Auto Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            
            Please review this pull request with a focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Security implications
            - Performance considerations
            
            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.
            
            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
            
          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment,Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)"
```

**Key Configuration:**
- Triggers on `opened` and `synchronize` (new commits)
- Always include `REPO` and `PR NUMBER` for context
- Specify tools for commenting and reviewing
- PR branch is pre-checked out

**Expected Output:** Claude posts review comments directly to the PR with inline annotations where appropriate.

## Review Only Specific File Paths

**When to use:** Review PRs only when specific critical files change.

**Complete Example:**

```yaml
name: Review Critical Files
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    paths:
      - 'src/auth/**'
      - 'src/api/**'
      - 'config/security.yml'

jobs:
  security-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            
            This PR modifies critical authentication or API files.
            
            Please provide a security-focused review with emphasis on:
            - Authentication and authorization flows
            - Input validation and sanitization
            - SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities
            - API security best practices
            
            Note: The PR branch is already checked out.
            
            Post detailed security findings as PR comments.
            
          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment,Bash(gh pr comment:*)"
```

**Key Configuration:**
- `paths:` filter triggers only for specific file changes
- Custom prompt emphasizes security for sensitive areas
- Useful for compliance or security reviews

**Expected Output:** Security-focused review when critical files are modified.

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review-with-tracking:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      # Create initial tracking comment
      - name: Create Tracking Comment
        id: tracking
        run: |
          COMMENT_BODY="## ðŸ¤– Claude Code Review in Progress
          
          - [ ] Analyzing code changes
          - [ ] Checking for security issues
          - [ ] Verifying test coverage
          - [ ] Reviewing documentation

          COMMENT_ID=$(gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} \
            --body "$COMMENT_BODY" --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
            --json id --jq .id)
          echo "comment_id=$COMMENT_ID" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1

          prompt: |
            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            TRACKING COMMENT ID: ${{ steps.tracking.outputs.comment_id }}
            
            Review this PR. After each major step, update the tracking comment:
            
            1. After analyzing changes: 
               `gh pr comment edit --comment-id [ID] --body "Updated status with analysis complete"`
            
            2. After security check:
               Mark security checkbox as [x]
            
            3. Continue for each checklist item
            
            Final comment should summarize findings.
            
          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*)"

      # Update tracking comment on completion
      - name: Complete Tracking Comment
        if: always()
        run: |
          gh pr comment edit --comment-id ${{ steps.tracking.outputs.comment_id }} \
            --body "## âœ… Claude Code Review Complete
            
            Review has finished. Check the full review comments above."
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

**Key Configuration:**
- Manual tracking comment creation
- Pass comment ID to Claude for updates
- Handles completion status

**Expected Output:** Visual progress tracking even in agent mode.

## Tips for All Solutions

### Always Include GitHub Context
```yaml
prompt: |
  REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
  PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  [Your specific instructions]
```

### Common Tool Permissions
- **PR Comments**: `Bash(gh pr comment:*)`
- **Inline Comments**: `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment`
- **File Operations**: `Read,Write,Edit`
- **Git Operations**: `Bash(git:*)`

### Best Practices
- Be specific in your prompts
- Include expected output format
- Set clear success criteria
- Provide context about the repository
- Use inline comments for code-specific feedback
